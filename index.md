We are a **research and learning** group led by [Prof. Matteo
Riondato](http://matteo.rionda.to) at [Amherst College](http://www.amherst.edu),
mostly in the [Computer Science](http://cs.amherst.edu) department.

We work on creating and learning about algorithms for *"everything data"*: data
mining, network science, machine learning, data science, knowledge discovery,
and databases.

The methods we develop often leverage randomness (e.g., sampling) and offer
strong guarantees on their performance.

Our research is sponsored, in part, by the National Science Foundation under
[award #2006765](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2006765).

You can often find us in courses such as COSC-254 Data Mining, COSC-257
Databases, COSC-355 Network Science, or taking an independent study with Matteo.

## How to join

If you are an Amherst student, and are interested in mixing data, computer
science, probability, and statistics, please contact Matteo. You must have taken
or being currently enrolled in COSC-211 Data Structures. Having taken one or
more courses in probability and/or statistics (e.g., STAT-135) is a plus, but
not necessary, although it would likely require you to spend a semester learning
probability, possibly in an independent study course with Matteo.
