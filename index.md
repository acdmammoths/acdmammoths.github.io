We are a **research and learning** group led by [Prof. Matteo
Riondato](http://matteo.rionda.to) at [Amherst College](http://www.amherst.edu),
mostly in the [Computer Science](http://cs.amherst.edu) department.

We create and learn about algorithms for *"everything data"*:[^1] data mining,
network science, machine learning, data science, knowledge discovery, databases,
and much more. You can read more about what we do in the [Q&A with
Matteo](https://www.amherst.edu/news/news_releases/2020/9-2020/computer-science-for-science)
for the college website.

The methods we develop often leverage randomness (e.g., sampling) and offer
strong guarantees on their performance.

Our research is sponsored, in part, by the National Science Foundation under
[award #2006765](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2006765).

When we are not working together at the whiteboard, writing code, or reading
papers, you can find us in courses such as COSC-254 Data Mining, COSC-257
Databases, COSC-355 Network Science, or taking an independent study course
(COSC-490) with Matteo.

 [^1]: That's the reason for the `*` in `Data*`, as `X*` means "everything X", in computer science jargon.

## How to join

If you are an Amherst student, and are interested in mixing data, computer
science, probability, and statistics, please contact Matteo. You must have taken
or being currently enrolled in COSC-211 Data Structures. Having taken one or
more courses in probability and/or statistics (e.g., STAT-135, COSC-223,
MATH/STAT-360) is a plus, but not necessary, although if you haven't, it is
likely that you will have to spend a semester learning probability, possibly in
an independent study course with Matteo.
