## Amherst College Data* Mammoths

### [News](#news)‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ  [Publications](#pubs)‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ  [Members](#members)‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ[How to join?](#join)

We are a **research and learning** group led by [Prof. Matteo
Riondato](http://matteo.rionda.to) at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu),
mostly in the [Computer Science](https://cs.amherst.edu) department.

We create and learn about algorithms for *"everything data"*:[^1] data mining,
network science, machine learning, data science, knowledge discovery, databases,
and much more. You can read more about what we do in the [Q&A with
Matteo](https://www.amherst.edu/news/news_releases/2020/9-2020/computer-science-for-science)
for the college website.

The methods we develop often leverage randomness (e.g., sampling, statistical
hypothesis testing, sketches) and offer strong guarantees on their performance.

Our research is sponsored, in part, by the National Science Foundation under
[award #2006765](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2006765).

When we are not working together at the whiteboard, writing code, or reading
papers, you can find us in courses such as [COSC-254 Data
Mining](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/2021S/COSC/COSC-254-2021S),
[COSC-257
Databases](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1920F/COSC/COSC-257-1920F),
[COSC-351 Information Theory](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/2223S/COSC/COSC-351-2223S),
[COSC-355 Network
Science](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/2223F/COSC/COSC-355-2223F),
or taking an independent study course (COSC-490) with Matteo.

## <a id="join"></a> How to join

If you are an Amherst student, and are interested in mixing data, computer
science, probability, and statistics, please contact Matteo. With rare
exceptions, you should have taken or be enrolled in COSC-211 Data Structures.
Having taken one or more courses in probability and/or statistics (e.g.,
STAT-135, COSC-223, MATH/STAT-360) is a plus, but not necessary, although if you
haven't, it is likely that you will get to spend a semester learning about
probability in computer science, possibly in an independent study course with
Matteo.

## üêò üíú üíæ  We love data!
